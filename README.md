# HARP Tracker
## What is it?
HARP Tracker is a graphical user interface (GUI) designed for ballooning ground station teams. Inspired by the HERMES GUI developed by the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, the project is currently under active development by Mercer University students Ayush Sahoo and Samhita Saragadam. It uses Rust and Tauri to ensure great performance, while still acheiving memory safety.
